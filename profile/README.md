# Baker Hughes - IET Artificial Intelligence Laboratory

IET AI Lab is the AI [Baker Hughes](https://www.bakerhughes.com/) Research Laboratory. See also [Baker Hughes AI](https://www.bakerhughes.com/ai)

## Safe, clean, efficient energy with intelligent technologies.

The AI Team's mission, which directly derives from the company's vision, is to improve safety, cleanliness and efficiency of energy with the utilization of intelligent technologies.

We want to accomplish this mission by following two parallel threads, the operational (first row in the graphic above) and the cultural (second row).

The goal of the operational thread is to demonstrate, on the basis of real projects, the AI impact on all of the company's activities in terms of productivity and revenues increase. To achieve this goal, we have defined two different sets of programs: the Lines of Action, which collect application projects with a well defined, internal customer, and the Enablers, which collect the development of tools and platforms aimed at increasing the execution speed of AI projects.

The goal of the cultural thread is to foster and accelerate a cultural change along the dimensions of agility, collaboration and competence.

### Plant Inspection using Computer Vision and Robotics
The goal is to automate inspection activities on a mineral lube oil skid used to lubricate gas turbines. The robot navigates autonomously around the skid and performs inspections on items such as analogic indicators, digital displays, sight glasses, level gauges, and electric motors using cameras, thermal cameras and microphones. Data is collected over routine missions to allow the development and training of additional computer vision and machine learning models.

### Design Optimization using AI
Accelerate the aerodynamic design process using AI. Aerodynamic designers use CFD to predict the performance of a new design or to find the effect of a geometry modification on an existing design. Defining new geometries, creating a mesh, launching a set of CFD runs (speedline) and postprocessing results requires significant human and computational resources. We are investigating different approaches (supervised and semi-supervised learning) to explore the design space and automatically find optimal designs, without the need to run one or more speedlines for each new design.
